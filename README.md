# javascript.conventions

Javascript coding conventions with focus on semantic value over cosmetics.

NOTE: This is a work-in-progress document and incorporates some of my own proposed conventions that may or may not be in line with the generally accepted and well known conventions in the JavaScript community.

### Disclaimer:

Most of this is a direct outcome of my previous Ruby development experience where expressiveness is a key factor. While I understand that it's a totally different programming language, I'd argue that some of the values the Ruby community represents could be applied to any other languages, including JavaScript.

Whilst I think it's important to discuss [cosmetics](http://sideeffect.kr/popularconvention#javascript), most of the communication is embedded in semantics and structure. In this repository I'd like to collect conventions (or proposed conventions) that enhance <s>readability</s> expressiveness and generally enhances intent and communication of code.

#TODO:

* ~~Write down the purpose of this document~~
* Collect more examples
